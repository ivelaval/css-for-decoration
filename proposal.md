# CSS For Decoration

CSS has powerful features intended for decoration: color gradients, shadows, filters, blend-modes, and many others. Their apparent complexity and ever-changing "design trends" means they're often underused and overlooked, sometimes replaced with unnecessary piles of HTML and black magic CSS with side effects so fragile that nobody dares touch ever again.

This talk is a collection of examples and practical use cases for CSS decoration features. From skeleton screens for improving perceived performance, generated polygon backgrounds, app UI details, like ranges, rulers and grids, down to the gratuitous but cool looking textured text and animated background shapes.

Everything done using standards-compliant CSS. No black magic, I promise.
